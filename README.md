# RepoMap

This repository contains a proof of concept map to display the archives present
in the [RepoData] dataset that have been assigned geo-coordinates. The map is
created with [Leaflet] and uses the Mapbox [SuperCluster] for clustering the over 25,000 points.

You can see it at: https://repodata.github.io/repomap/
